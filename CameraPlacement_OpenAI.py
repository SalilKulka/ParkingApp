# This code assumes that you have a grayscale map image in which buildings are represented by pixels with a value of 1 and roads are represented by pixels with a value of 0. 
# The code finds the coordinates of all the buildings on the map, and then iterates over them to compute the coverage area of the camera at each building. 
# The coverage area is calculated by considering the maximum distance that the camera can see in the x and y directions, which is determined by the camera's field of view angle and the map scale. 
# Finally, the code finds the index of the building with the maximum coverage area, and extracts its coordinates to print them out.

    # Compute the coverage area of the camera at this building
